                        Flannan Isles was on 15
                        December 1900
                        when
                        the steamer Archtor,
                        on a passage from Philadelphia to Leith, noted in its log that the light was not
                        operational
                        in
                        poor
                        weather conditions.
                        When the ship docked in Leith on 18 December 1900, the sighting was passed on to the
                        Northern
                        Lighthouse Board. The
                        relief vessel, the lighthouse tender Hesperus, was unable to sail from Breasclete,
                        Lewis, as
                        planned
                        on 20 December due
                        to adverse weather; it did not reach the island until noon on 26 December.[8] The
                        lighthouse
                        was
                        manned by three men:
                        James Ducat, Thomas Marshall and Donald McArthur, with a rotating fourth man
                        spending time
                        on
                        shore. </p>
                    <p class="pallign">
                        On arrival, the crew of the Hesperus and the relief keeper found that the flagpole
                        had no
                        flag,
                        none of the usual
                        provision boxes had been left on the landing stage for restocking and, more
                        ominously, none
                        of
                        the lighthouse keepers
                        were there to welcome them ashore. Jim Harvie, the captain of Hesperus, attempted to
                        reach
                        them
                        by blowing the ship's
                        whistle and firing a flare but was unsuccessful.

                        A boat was launched and Joseph Moore, the relief keeper, was put ashore alone. He
                        found the
                        entrance gate to the
                        compound and the main door both closed, the beds unmade and the clock unwound.
                        Returning to
                        the
                        landing stage with this
                        grim news, he then went back up to the lighthouse with Hesperus's second mate and a
                        seaman.
                        A
                        further search revealed
                        that the lamps had been cleaned and refilled. A set of oilskins was found,
                        suggesting that
                        one
                        of the keepers had left
                        the lighthouse without them. There was no sign of any of the keepers, neither inside
                        the
                        lighthouse nor anywhere on the
                        island.

                        Moore and three volunteer seamen were left on the island to attend the light and
                        Hesperus
                        returned to Lewis.

                        On Eilean Mòr the men scoured every corner of the island for clues as to the fate of
                        the
                        keepers. They found that
                        everything was intact at the east landing but the west landing provided considerable
                        evidence of
                        damage caused by recent
                        storms. A box at 33 metres (108 ft) above sea level had been broken and its contents
                        strewn
                        about; iron railings were
                        bent over, the iron railway by the path was wrenched out of its concrete and a rock

                        more than a ton had been
                        displaced. On top of the cliff, at more than 60 metres (200 ft) above sea level,
                        turf had
                        been

                            On 29 December 1900 Robert Muirhead, a Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB) superintendent,
                            arrived
                            to conduct the official
                            investigation into the incident. Muirhead had originally recruited all three of the missing
                            men
                            and knew them
                            personally.
                            He examined the clothing left behind in the lighthouse and concluded that Ducat and Marshall
                            had
                            gone down to the
                            western landing stage and that McArthur (the 'Occasional') had left the lighthouse during
                            heavy
                            rain in his shirt
                            sleeves. He noted that whoever left the light last and unattended was in breach of NLB
                            rules.
                            He also noted that some
                            of the damage to the west landing was "difficult to believe unless actually seen".

                                    the 15th of December, that they had gone down to secure a box in which the mooring
                                    ropes, landing ropes etc. were kept,
                                    and which was secured in a crevice in the rock about 110 feet [34 meters] above sea

                        Over time a story has developed of the existence of unusual log book entries.
                        They
                        supposedly
                        have Marshall saying on 12
                        December that there were "severe winds the likes of which I have never seen
                        before in twenty
                        years". He also is said to
                        have reported that Ducat had been "very quiet" and Donald McArthur had been
                        crying. McArthur
                        was
                        a veteran mariner with
                        a reputation for brawling, and thus it would be strange for him to be crying in
                        response to
                        a
                        storm. Log entries on 13
                        December were said to have stated that the storm was still raging and that all
                        three men had
                        been praying. This was also
                        puzzling, as all three men were experienced lighthouse keepers who knew they
                        were in a
                        secure
                        structure 150 feet above
                        sea level and should have known they were safe inside. Furthermore, there had
                        been no
                        reported
                        storms in the area on the
                        12, 13 and 14 December. The final log entry is said to have been made on 15
                        December,
                        stating
                        "Storm ended, sea calm.
                        God is over all." However an investigation by Mike Dash for the Fortean Times
                        revealed that
                        the
                        logbooks were fictional,
                        later additions to the story.

                        Subsequent researchers have taken into account the geography of the islands.
                        The
                        coastline of
                        Eilean Mòr is deeply
                        indented with narrow gullies called geos. The west landing, which is situated in
                        such a geo,
                        terminates in a cave. In
                        high seas or storms water would rush into the cave and then explode out again
                        with
                        considerable
                        force. It was possible
                        McArthur saw a series of large waves approaching the island and, knowing the
                        likely danger
                        to
                        his colleagues, ran down
                        to warn them only to be washed away as well in the violent swell. Recent
                        research by
                        James
                        Love discovered that
                        Marshall was previously fined five shillings when his equipment was washed away
                        during a
                        huge
                        gale. It is likely, in
                        seeking to avoid another fine, that he and Ducat tried to secure their equipment
                        during a
                        storm
                        and were swept away as a
                        result. The fate of McArthur, although he had been required to stay behind to
                        man the
                        lighthouse, can be guessed to be
                        the same. Love speculates that McArthur probably tried to warn or help his
                        colleagues and
                        was
                        swept away too. This
                        theory also has the advantage of explaining the set of oilskins remaining
                        indoors and
                        McArthur's
                        coat remaining on its
                        peg, although perhaps not the closed door and gate.[26] Another theory is
                        based on
                        the
                        first-hand experiences of
                        Walter Aldebert, a keeper on the Flannans from 1953 to 1957. He believed one man
                        may have
                        been
                        washed into the sea but
                        then his companions, who were trying to rescue him, were washed away by more
                        rogue waves.
