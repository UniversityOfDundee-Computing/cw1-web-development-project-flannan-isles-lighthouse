                    <p>The first record[3] that something was abnormal on the Flannan Isles was on 15 December 1900 when
                        the steamer Archtor,
                        on a passage from Philadelphia to Leith, noted in its log that the light was not operational in
                        poor
                        weather conditions.
                        When the ship docked in Leith on 18 December 1900, the sighting was passed on to the Northern
                        Lighthouse Board.[10] The
                        relief vessel, the lighthouse tender Hesperus, was unable to sail from Breasclete, Lewis, as
                        planned
                        on 20 December due
                        to adverse weather; it did not reach the island until noon on 26 December.[8] The lighthouse was
                        manned by three men:
                        James Ducat, Thomas Marshall and Donald McArthur, with a rotating fourth man spending time on
                        shore.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On arrival, the crew of the Hesperus and the relief keeper found that the flagpole had no flag,
                        none of the usual
                        provision boxes had been left on the landing stage for restocking and, more ominously, none of
                        the lighthouse keepers
                        were there to welcome them ashore. Jim Harvie, the captain of Hesperus, attempted to reach them
                        by blowing the ship's
                        whistle and firing a flare but was unsuccessful.

                        A boat was launched and Joseph Moore, the relief keeper, was put ashore alone. He found the
                        entrance gate to the
                        compound and the main door both closed, the beds unmade and the clock unwound. Returning to the
                        landing stage with this
                        grim news, he then went back up to the lighthouse with Hesperus's second mate and a seaman. A
                        further search revealed
                        that the lamps had been cleaned and refilled. A set of oilskins was found, suggesting that one
                        of the keepers had left
                        the lighthouse without them. There was no sign of any of the keepers, neither inside the
                        lighthouse nor anywhere on the
                        island.[8][13]

                        Moore and three volunteer seamen were left on the island to attend the light and Hesperus
                        returned to Lewis.

                        On Eilean Mòr the men scoured every corner of the island for clues as to the fate of the
                        keepers. They found that
                        everything was intact at the east landing but the west landing provided considerable
                        evidence of
                        damage caused by recent
                        storms. A box at 33 metres (108 ft) above sea level had been broken and its contents strewn
                        about; iron railings were
                        bent over, the iron railway by the path was wrenched out of its concrete and a rock weighing
                        more than a ton had been
                        displaced. On top of the cliff, at more than 60 metres (200 ft) above sea level, turf had
                        been
                        ripped away as far as 10
                        metres (33 ft) from the cliff edge.

                        On 29 December 1900 Robert Muirhead, a Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB) superintendent, arrived
                        to conduct the official
                        investigation into the incident. Muirhead had originally recruited all three of the missing men
                        and knew them
                        personally.[15][16]

                    <p>
                        He examined the clothing left behind in the lighthouse and concluded that Ducat and Marshall had
                        gone down to the
                        western landing stage and that McArthur (the 'Occasional') had left the lighthouse during heavy
                        rain in his shirt
                        sleeves. He noted that whoever left the light last and unattended was in breach of NLB rules.[8]
                        He also noted that some
                        of the damage to the west landing was "difficult to believe unless actually seen".

                                ropes, landing ropes etc. were kept,
                                and which was secured in a crevice in the rock about 110 feet [34 meters] above sea
                                level, and that an extra large sea
                                had rushed up the face of the rock, had gone above them, and coming down with immense
                                force, had swept them completely

                        Whether this explanation brought any comfort to the families of the lost keepers (Ducat left a
                        wife
                        and four children;
                        McArthur a wife and two children) is unknown.[17] This development did, however, tarnish the
                        lighthouse's reputation for
                        many years after the incident.

                        No bodies were ever found, but there have been some mysterious sights resulting in "fascinated
                        national speculation" in
                        newspapers and periodicals of the era.[20] Implausible stories ensued, such as that a sea
                        serpent had carried the men
                        away; that they had arranged for a ship to take them away and start new lives; that they had
                        been abducted by foreign
                        spies; or that they had met their fate through the malevolent presence of a boat filled with
                        ghosts (the baleful
                        influence of the ‘Phantom of the Seven Hunters’ was widely suspected locally).[8] More than ten
                        years later the events
                        were still being commemorated and elaborated on. The 1912 ballad Flannan Isle by Wilfrid Wilson
                        Gibson refers
                        erroneously to an overturned chair and uneaten meal laid out on the table, indicating that the
                        keepers had been suddenly
                        disturbed.

                        Over time a story has developed of the existence of unusual log book entries. They supposedly
                        have Marshall saying on 12
                        December that there were "severe winds the likes of which I have never seen before in twenty
                        years". He also is said to
                        have reported that Ducat had been "very quiet" and Donald McArthur had been crying. McArthur was
                        a veteran mariner with
                        a reputation for brawling, and thus it would be strange for him to be crying in response to a
                        storm. Log entries on 13
                        December were said to have stated that the storm was still raging and that all three men had
                        been praying. This was also
                        puzzling, as all three men were experienced lighthouse keepers who knew they were in a secure
                        structure 150 feet above
                        sea level and should have known they were safe inside. Furthermore, there had been no reported
                        storms in the area on the
                        12, 13 and 14 December. The final log entry is said to have been made on 15 December, stating
                        "Storm ended, sea calm.
                        God is over all." However an investigation by Mike Dash for the Fortean Times revealed that the
                        logbooks were fictional,
                        later additions to the story.

                        Subsequent researchers have taken into account the geography of the islands.[8] The coastline of
                        Eilean Mòr is deeply
                        indented with narrow gullies called geos. The west landing, which is situated in such a geo,
                        terminates in a cave. In
                        high seas or storms water would rush into the cave and then explode out again with considerable
                        force. It was possible
                        McArthur saw a series of large waves approaching the island and, knowing the likely danger to
                        his colleagues, ran down
                        to warn them only to be washed away as well in the violent swell.[23] Recent research by James
                        Love discovered that
                        Marshall was previously fined five shillings when his equipment was washed away during a huge
                        gale. It is likely, in
                        seeking to avoid another fine, that he and Ducat tried to secure their equipment during a storm
                        and were swept away as a
                        result. The fate of McArthur, although he had been required to stay behind to man the
                        lighthouse, can be guessed to be
                        the same. Love speculates that McArthur probably tried to warn or help his colleagues and was
                        swept away too.[24] This
                        theory also has the advantage of explaining the set of oilskins remaining indoors and McArthur's
                        coat remaining on its
                        peg,[8][25] although perhaps not the closed door and gate.[26] Another theory is based on the
                        first-hand experiences of
                        Walter Aldebert, a keeper on the Flannans from 1953 to 1957. He believed one man may have been
                        washed into the sea but
                        then his companions, who were trying to rescue him, were washed away by more rogue waves.
